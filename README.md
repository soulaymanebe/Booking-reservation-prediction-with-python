# Booking-reservation-prediction-with-python
Our goal is to first process the database, then analyze it and finally make a study and a model in which we will predict whether a reservation will be canceled or not. Our database describes data on demand for hotels. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a City Hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel reservation. Since this is actual hotel data, all data elements relating to the hotel or guest identification have been removed.
